    <h4>This classic, dark chocolate chip brownie recipe produces dense, fudgy brownies with a signature crackly, thin crust and an intensely chocolatey flavor</h4>

    <p><u><b>Ingredients:</b></u></p>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>1.5 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ol>

    <p><u><b>Instructions:</b></u></p>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees farenheight. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper.
                Spray the parchment paper</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top.
                Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).
                Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>

        </ol>

            <h4><u>ENJOY!</u></h4>
